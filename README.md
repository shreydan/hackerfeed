- it's super basic. 30 top posts on mobile, can open the linked website directly
- no fetch-on-scroll thingy because I only read the front-page
- only top posts since I read new ones when I'm super bored that too on my laptop
- this app is just for light reading and to peek at the headlines when away from laptop
- any post item will open the browser directly if it has a URL otherwise if it's some sorta story it'll let me read the story within the app
- super basic material 3 light theme UI
- v5.0 so I didn't include rendering comments (I love reading comments but I hate building apps so if I start using the app more, I'll add that feature).
- this app is an excuse for me to get into app-dev (not really)
- simple first app :D
- IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- ~~fun~~ weekend project?
